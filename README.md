## Introduction

This project explores the integration of quantum computing into machine learning models for regression tasks. Specifically, it predicts the probability of an accident occurring based on various features related to the driver and vehicle.

The hybrid model consists of classical neural network layers and a custom quantum layer that processes data using a parameterized quantum circuit. The quantum layer is implemented using Qiskit, and the classical layers are built with PyTorch.

- `.env`: Environment file containing IBM Quantum credentials.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `car_insurance_risk_data.xlsx`: Dataset containing features and target variable.
- `hybrid_qnn.py`: Main script containing the code for data preprocessing, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- IBM Quantum account for accessing real quantum hardware (optional)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository

	2.	Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate


	3.	Install Required Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Set Up Environment Variables
	•	Create a .env file in the project root directory.
	•	Add your IBM Quantum credentials:

IBM_QUANTUM_TOKEN=your_ibm_quantum_token
IBM_INSTANCE=your_ibm_instance

You can obtain these credentials by signing up at IBM Quantum and creating a new API token.

	5.	Ensure Dataset Availability
	•	The car_insurance_risk_data.xlsx file should be in the project root directory.
	•	If you have a different dataset, adjust the file path and feature/target column names in the code accordingly.

Dataset

The dataset (car_insurance_risk_data.xlsx) should contain the following columns:

	•	Features:
	•	Driver Age
	•	Number of Accidents
	•	Number of Traffic Violations
	•	Vehicle Safety Rating
	•	Target Variable:
	•	Accident Probability

Ensure that these columns are present in your dataset or modify the code to match your data.

Code Overview

The code is organized into functions and classes for better readability and maintainability. Below is an overview of the main components.

1. Environment Setup

	•	Loading Environment Variables: The script loads IBM Quantum credentials from the .env file using dotenv.
	•	Initializing Qiskit Runtime Service: The service is initialized to access quantum backends.

2. Data Loading and Preprocessing

	•	Loading the Dataset: The data is read from the Excel file using pandas.
	•	Feature Selection: Specific features and the target variable are selected.
	•	Data Standardization: Features are standardized using StandardScaler.
	•	Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
	•	Data Conversion: Data is converted to PyTorch tensors for model training.

3. Quantum Circuit Definition

	•	Parameter Vectors: Parameter vectors for data (data_params) and trainable parameters (theta_params) are created.
	•	Quantum Circuit Creation: A parameterized quantum circuit is defined using Qiskit, incorporating data encoding and variational layers.

4. Backend Selection

	•	User Prompt: The script prompts the user to select a backend:
	•	Local simulator (AerSimulator)
	•	Least busy real quantum backend
	•	Specific real quantum backend
	•	Backend Initialization: The selected backend is initialized for quantum circuit execution.

5. Model Definition

	•	Quantum Layer: A custom QuantumLayer class is defined, integrating quantum computations into PyTorch.
	•	Hybrid Neural Network: The HybridNN class combines classical layers with the quantum layer.
	•	Model Initialization: The model is initialized, and the loss function and optimizer are defined.

6. Training and Evaluation

	•	Training Options: The user can choose to train from scratch, continue training, or use a saved model.
	•	Model Training: The model is trained using batch processing, and training loss is recorded.
	•	Model Saving: The trained model is saved to a file for future use.
	•	Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test set, and metrics are calculated.
	•	Visualization: Training loss and predicted vs. actual values are plotted using matplotlib.

Usage

Running the Script

Execute the script from the command line:

python hybrid_qnn.py

Selecting Backend and Training Options

	1.	Backend Selection: When prompted, select the backend:

Choose a backend to run the quantum job:
1. Use a local simulator (AerSimulator)
2. Use the least busy backend of a real quantum computer
3. Use a specific backend (real quantum computer)
4. Close session
Enter your choice (1, 2, 3, or 4):

	•	Option 1 is recommended for testing and development.

	2.	Training Choice: If a saved model exists, you’ll be prompted:

Choose an option:
1. Train the model from scratch
2. Continue training from the saved model
3. Use the saved model without further training
Enter your choice (1, 2, or 3):

	•	Select the desired option based on your needs.

Interpreting Results

	•	Training Progress: The script prints the loss at regular intervals during training.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: After evaluation, the following metrics are displayed:
	•	Mean Squared Error (MSE)
	•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
	•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
	•	R-squared Score (R²)
	•	Plots:
	•	Training Loss Plot: Visualizes how the loss decreases over epochs.
	•	Predicted vs. Actual Plot: Shows the relationship between predicted and actual accident probabilities.

Customization

	•	Hyperparameters: Modify constants at the top of the script to change:
	•	BATCH_SIZE
	•	NUM_EPOCHS
	•	LEARNING_RATE
	•	Data File Path: Update DATA_FILE_PATH if your dataset is located elsewhere.
	•	Model Save Path: Change MODEL_SAVE_PATH to save the model to a different location.
	•	Feature and Target Columns: Adjust FEATURE_COLUMNS and TARGET_COLUMN to match your dataset.

Troubleshooting

	•	Qiskit Errors:
	•	Ensure that you have the latest version of Qiskit installed.
	•	Verify that your IBM Quantum credentials are correct.
	•	Dataset Issues:
	•	Check that the dataset file exists and the file path is correct.
	•	Ensure that the required columns are present in the dataset.
	•	Module Import Errors:
	•	Install missing packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	Quantum Circuit Execution Errors:
	•	If using a real quantum backend, be aware of queue times and possible errors due to noise.
