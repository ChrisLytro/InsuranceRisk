# Quantum Car Insurance Risk Assessment

This project implements a **Quantum Machine Learning Model** to assess and predict car insurance risks using a hybrid **quantum-classical neural network**. It leverages IBM Quantum's real quantum processors through the **Qiskit** framework, integrated with **PyTorch** for building and training the classical-quantum hybrid neural network.

## Project Overview

The model uses real-time and historical data to predict **Accident Probability** for cars based on multiple factors such as:

- Driver data: age, number of accidents, number of traffic violations, etc.
- Vehicle data: make, model, safety ratings, and modifications.
- External conditions: weather, traffic patterns, and usage in high-risk times.

The model implements a hybrid quantum-classical approach:
- **Classical Neural Network Layers**: For traditional data preprocessing and initial transformations.
- **Quantum Neural Network Layer**: A variational quantum circuit is used within the neural network to enhance the model's ability to predict accident risks.

### How it works
1.	Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed and standardized using sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.
2.	Classical Layers: Classical layers of the neural network process the input features such as driver age, number of accidents, and vehicle data.
3.	Quantum Layer: A variational quantum circuit (VQC) layer is integrated into the neural network to enhance prediction capabilities. This layer leverages IBM Quantumâ€™s real hardware to provide additional computational power for complex correlations.
4.	Training: The hybrid model is trained using PyTorch, with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for predicting accident probability.
5.	Execution on Real Quantum Hardware: The quantum circuit is executed on an IBM Quantum backend using the Qiskit Runtime service. The variational quantum circuit (VQC) adjusts its parameters based on the training data and contributes to the final accident probability prediction.
